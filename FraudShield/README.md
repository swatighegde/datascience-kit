# FraudShield â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection System  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
Fraudulent credit card transactions are a major challenge for the financial industry, leading to significant losses and reduced customer trust. **FraudShield** is a machine learning project that leverages **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand transaction patterns and class imbalance.  
- Preprocess the dataset (scaling, handling imbalance with **SMOTE**).  
- Build and evaluate multiple models:  
  - **Logistic Regression** (baseline)  
  - **RandomForestClassifier** (ensemble approach)  
  - **XGBClassifier** (gradient boosting)  
- Compare performance across models using:  
  - **Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC**  
- Visualize results with **confusion matrices, ROC curves**.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset 
- **Source:** [Kaggle â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Results  

- Logistic Regression achieved high recall but very low precision, meaning it detected most frauds but also raised many false alarms.  
- Random Forest provided excellent precision and overall accuracy, but recall was slightly lower compared to Logistic Regression.  
- XGBoost offered the best balance between precision and recall, delivering the most reliable performance for fraud detection.  
- Overall, ensemble methods (Random Forest and XGBoost) outperformed Logistic Regression, with XGBoost emerging as the most effective model.
