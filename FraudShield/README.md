# FraudShield â€“ Credit Card Fraud Detection System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
FraudShield is a machine learning project that detects fraudulent credit card transactions.  
It uses **Logistic Regression** to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine based on historical data.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/` â†’ Transaction dataset (e.g., Kaggle Credit Card Fraud dataset)
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter notebooks for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- `README.md` â†’ Project documentation

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Load and preprocess dataset
- Train Logistic Regression model
- Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
