## 📂 Projects  

### 1. FraudShield – Credit Card Fraud Detection System  
Fraudulent credit card transactions remain one of the biggest challenges in the financial sector, leading to substantial losses and reduced customer trust. **FraudShield** is a machine learning project built to detect fraudulent activities with high accuracy. It leverages **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost** models to classify transactions and strengthen fraud prevention mechanisms.

### 2. CineMatch – Personalized Movie Recommendation System  
**CineMatch** delivers personalized movie suggestions through a **Hybrid Recommendation System** developed on the MovieLens dataset. By blending **Collaborative Filtering** (user–item rating patterns) with **Content-Based Filtering** (movie metadata like genres and tags), the system generates more accurate recommendations. This hybrid model improves personalization, enhances engagement, and ensures better user experiences.
